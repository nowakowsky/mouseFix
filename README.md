## Blocks doubleclick caused by damaged hardware

My mouse has been damaged so I was looking for temporary fix.
I've written those lines to block second click if it occurs less than 200ms after last one.

[Working .exe release (hardcoded 200ms interval)](https://github.com/nowakowsky/mouseFix/releases)

To change interval change COOLDOWN in code and compile yourself
